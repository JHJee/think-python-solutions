Excercise 3.1. Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\Jihye\Desktop\TP-Chapter3.py", line 3, in <module>
    repeat_lyrics()
NameError: name 'repeat_lyrics' is not defined

Exercise 3.2. Move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics. What happens when you run this program?

It runs properly.
